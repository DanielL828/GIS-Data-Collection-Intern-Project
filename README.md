When viewing the attribute table in GIS software like ArcGIS Pro or QGIS the column names may get compressed to the following:
 
So here is what those headings represent:
OrgnlSN = Original Shapefile Name Agency = Agency
DTAcqrd = Date Acquired
Acreage = Acreage
TF(Dys) = Time Frame (Days) PrjctNM = Project Name Trtmnt T = Treatment Type DtCmplt = Date Completed Other = Other
